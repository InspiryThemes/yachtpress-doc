## Create Home Page

!!! info ""
    In case of <strong>Demo Contents Import</strong> the home page is already created and you do not need to follow this section.

To set up the Home page you need to create a new page,
Go to <strong>Pages → Add New</strong>. You can give this page a title "<strong>Home</strong>" yet you do not need to include any contents for now.
Select the “<strong>Home Template</strong>” template from the Page Attributes section, as displayed in screen shot below and click <strong>“Publish”</strong>.

## Configure Reading Settings

!!! info ""
    In case you followed <strong>Demo Contents Import</strong>, The reading settings should already be configured and you do not need to follow this section.

I am assuming that you have imported the XML successfully and you have home page and news page available for use. If this is not the case then simply create a new page using <strong>Home Template</strong> and name it as Home after that create another page using default template and name it as News.
To configure reading settings you need to visit <strong>Dashboard</strong> → <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Reading</strong> and choose that front page displays as static page. Then select Home as Front Page and News as Posts Page. As, displayed in screen shot below.
