            <strong>Difference Between Author Profile Information and Agent's Information</strong>
            From website visitor point of view there is no difference and information from both will be displayed in similar way.<br>
            From website admin point of view, <strong>An author</strong> is basically a site user/member that login into site and add a boat using admin side ( If his role is author or above ) OR add a boat from front end boat submission page ( if his role is subscriber ). <strong>An agent</strong> is a custom post type and any user with role equal or above author role can add those agents into database and later on assign properties to those agents. So, basically it is a flexible feature that can be used in a way that match your needs.
